This repository contains simple python scripts I created to learn the language and experiment what I can do using python at my current level of understanding.
every project is noted to make each line of code understandable to the reader. The notes make even a amateur coder like myself understand what each line of code does.

The **first** project I made was the **Simple calculator** - https://github.com/Adamorris/Python/blob/main/Simple%20Calculator.py
This project takes two numbers and adds them together. 

The **second** project I made is still simple but works, the **Weight converter** - https://github.com/Adamorris/Python/blob/main/Simple%20Weight%20Converter.py
This project takes one unit of weight, either Pounds or Kilograms, and converts it to the other. 

The **third** project i created was making a simple two minute countdown, the **Simple countdown** - https://github.com/Adamorris/Python/blob/main/Simple%20Countdown.py
This project just shows a countdown of two minutes. This project uses the most complex code out of the three i have created thus far
