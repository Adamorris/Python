This repository contains simple python scripts I created to learn the language and experiment what I can do using python at my current level of understanding.
The first project I made was the **Simple calculator** - https://github.com/Adamorris/Python/blob/main/Simple%20Calculator.py
This project takes two numbers and adds them together.

The second project I made is still simple but works, the **Weight converter** - https://github.com/Adamorris/Python/blob/main/Simple%20Weight%20Converter.py
This project takes one unit of weight, either Pounds or Kilograms, and converts it to the other.
